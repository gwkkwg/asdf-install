The original ASDF-INSTALL code (the files Makefile, README,
asdf-install.asd, defpackage.lisp, and installer.lisp) was written by
Daniel Barlow <dan@telent.net> and is distributed with SBCL and
therefore in the public domain.  The SBCL Common Lisp implementation
can be obtained from Sourceforge: <http://sbcl.sf.net/>.

The initial port of ASDF-INSTALL to other Lisps was done by Dr. Edmund
Weitz <edi@agharta.de> and included the file port.lisp and some
changes to the files mentioned above.  More code was provided by Marco
Baringer <mb@bese.it> (OpenMCL port), James Anderson
<james.anderson@setf.de> (MCL port, including the file digitool.lisp),
Kiyoshi Mizumaru <maru@krc.sony.co.jp>, Robert P. Goldman
<rpgoldman@sift.info>, and Raymond Toy <toy@rtp.ericsson.se>
(bugfixes).  Marco Antoniotti <marcoxa@cs.nyu.edu> added support for
MK:DEFSYSTEM which includes the files load-asdf-install.lisp,
loader.lisp, and finally split-sequence.lisp which has its own
copyright notice. ASDF-Install is currently maintained by Gary King
<gwking@metabang.com> and is hosted on Common-Lisp.net.
