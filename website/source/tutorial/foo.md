### Hello

Apart from one of the [supported Lisps][61] you will need [GnuPG][62] (which is  pre-installed on most Linux distributions but not on OS X). Install it first if you don't have it already. You may also need to install [the GNU version of `tar`][63] if you're not on Linux. Hell, you may even want to [eat mean][64].
