<BLOCKQUOTE><P></P><H3>Overview </H3>
</BLOCKQUOTE><P>This tutorial is intended for people who are new to Common Lisp <STRONG>and</STRONG> for people who are new to ASDF-Install. It describes an easy way to install third-party libraries into a Lisp environment. </P><P>Common Lisp is a wonderful language but it doesn't include built-in support  for things many have come to expect (for example: XML, web servers, GUIs, regular expressions and so on). Not to worry, though, most of these needs are ably  served by vendors and the teaming world of third party software libraries. Even better, Common Lisp has a tool that helps find libraries, install them, manage  dependencies and keep things up to date. That tool is ASDF-Install and that's  what this tutorial is all about. There are several paths you can take to get through the tutorial: </P><UL><LI><P>Read the <a href="introduction.html">introduction</a> if you're interested in learning more about Lisp, the ASDF tool and the history of ASDF-Install.  </P></LI>
<LI><P>If you need help getting your Lisp environment setup, installing ASDF and ASDF-Install, then you'll want to see the <a href="setup.html">prerequisites</a></P></LI>
<LI><P>Once you're all setup, you'll want to know how to <a href="install.html">install</a> and <a href="uninstall.html">uninstall</a> software libraries. </P></LI>
<LI><P>Lastly (or perhaps firstly), you'll want to know the ins- and outs- of ASDF-Install. For that, see the <a href="reference.html">reference</a>. </P></LI>
<LI><P>Oh, and if you like the details and the fine print, don't forget to see the <a href="changelog.html">changelog</a> and the <a href="copyright.html">license and copyright</a>. </P></LI>
